Shiny App Readme
================
Group Name:other-carp

This folder contains all the files (beside data) to generate final Shiny app . The app itself is in file “app.R”. When demonstrating, we should directly run “app.R”. All the codes should go in to “app.R”. There will be figure and other folders under this folder later.
